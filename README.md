This repository contains several rust crates that can be used to setup a
[tracing.rs] `Subscriber` that will stream your system's trace data directly
into modality in real time.

The main user interface exists in [tracing-modality], see its readme for how to
get started.

[tracing.rs]: https://tracing.rs/
[tracing-modality]: ./tracing-modality
